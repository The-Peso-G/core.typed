* Unsoundness in core.typed

core.typed is mostly designed to be a sound type system besides
(at least) these features.

** Array-backed seqs

We assume anything implementing IPersistentCollection is immutable.

** Vars

We assume that vars are always bound, and they are always
set to values of their annotated type.
